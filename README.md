# Mini Food Delivery App

This is a sample Android application demonstrating a mini food delivery system. It's built using modern Android development practices,
 leveraging Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the UI, and Hilt for dependency injection.

## Features (Planned or Implemented)

*   Browse a list of available food items.
*   View details for each food item.
*   Add items to a shopping cart.
*   Simulate an order placement
*    process.
*   (Potentially) User authentication.
*   (Potentially) Restaurant listings.

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building the user interface declaratively.
*   **Navigation Compose:** For handling in-app navigation.
*   **ViewModel:** To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
*   **Hilt (Dagger):** For dependency injection, making the codebase more modular and testable.
*   **Retrofit & Gson:** For making network requests to a backend
*    API (if applicable) and parsing JSON data.
*   **OkHttp Logging Interceptor:** For debugging network requests.
*   **Room:** For local data persistence (if applicable, e.g., for caching or storing user preferences).
*   **AndroidX Libraries:** Core Android Jetpack libraries.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Android application structure. Key components include:

*   **`app/src/main/java/com/example/minifooddeliveryapp`**: Contains the core Kotlin source code.
    *   **`MainActivity.kt`**: The main entry point of the application.
    *   **(Likely sub-packages for UI (Composables), ViewModels, Data (Repositories, Network, Database), DI (Hilt modules), etc.)**
*   **`app/src/main/res`**: Contains XML resources like layouts (though primarily Compose is used), drawables, strings, etc.
*   **`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**: Defines the application's components, permissions, and other essential information.

## Setup and Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Open Android Studio.
    *   Click on "Open an Existing Project".
    *   Navigate to the cloned directory and select it.
3.  **Sync Gradle:** Android Studio should automatically sync the project and download necessary dependencies.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    *   Select an emulator or connect a physical device.
    *   Click the "Run" button (green play icon) in Android Studio.

## Dependencies

The project uses Gradle to manage dependencies. Key dependencies are listed in the `app/build.gradle.kts` (or `app/build.gradle`) file. Some of the notable ones include:

*   `androidx.activity:activity-compose`
*   `androidx.compose:compose-bom`
*   `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose`
*   `androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose`
*   `com.google.dagger:hilt-android`
*   `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit`
*   `androidx.room:room-runtime`

*(You can add more specific versions here if you like, but generally, the `build.gradle` file is the source of truth for versions).*

## Permissions

The application requests the following permissions (as seen in `AndroidManifest.xml`):

*   `android.permission.INTERNET`: Required for making network requests (e.g., to fetch food data from an API).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6.  Open a Pull Request.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Real-time order tracking.
*   User reviews and ratings.
*   Payment integration.
*   More sophisticated search and filtering options.
*   Push notifications for order updates.
